## Workflow

1. Clone

2. Install code style tools
```bash
pip install pre-commit==1.17.0
apt install clang-format-9
ln -s /usr/bin/clang-format-9 /usr/bin/clang-format
```

3. At your local repo root, run
```bash
pre-commit install
```

4. Make change to your code and test. You can run all the existing unittests by the following command:
```bash
# TODO
unittest ...
```

Then commit your change to the local branch using `git commit`

5. Make pull request:
```bash
arc diff
```

6. Change your code based on review comments. The new change should be added
as NEW commit to your previous commits. Then you should update the revision
```bash
arc diff --update
```

7. Publish an accepted revision after review
```bash
arc land
```
